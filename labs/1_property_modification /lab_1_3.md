# Lab 1_3 - DOM Manipulation

### Challenge yourself!

- create a directive for showing a `tooltip` on `mousehover`
- the `tootltip` will get a text as input
- on `mousehover` - you should display the tooltip inside a `<span>` tag

#### Notes
- It doesn't need to be styled!
- Use binding decorators
